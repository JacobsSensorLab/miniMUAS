# miniMUAS
A framework for programming multi UAS systems using NDN.

Note: ignore minimuas_GCS.cpp; this is legacy code during development phase

### TODO
- Explain NDNSF (service user, provider, and controller)
- Explain general program architecture
- Generalize the code to convert into library
- Move current app code into examples
